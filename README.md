### Hello! ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ben. I am a web developer emerging from the adventure tourism industry. For ten years I worked as a scuba instructor and whitewater raft guide, then managed a rafting and outdoor education center in California, discovering an interest in the web side of the business. I have since plunged myself into the world of coding.

- ğŸ’¬  _Ask me about:_ octopus! Their brains aren't where you would think and they have more hearts than elephants have ears.
- ğŸ“«  _Get in Touch:_  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben--hernandez/)
- âš¡ _Fun fact:_ As if the wild-but-true octopus facts aren't enough: while humans have three photoreceptors (and see three primary colors), mantis shrimp have between 12 and 16 photoreceptors and can also see ultraviolet light!

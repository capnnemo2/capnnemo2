### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ben. I am a web developer emerging from the adventure tourism industry. For ten years I worked as a scuba instructor and whitewater raft guide, then managed a rafting and outdoor education center in California, discovering an interest in the web side of the business. I have since plunged myself into the world of coding.

- ðŸ”­  _Currently working on:_ a tool to create [crossword puzzles](https://github.com/TopSecretShh/x-word), a new portfolio site, and an e-commerce store.
- ðŸŒ±  _Currently learning:_ React hooks, Gatsby, Shopify, WordPress.
- ðŸ’¬  _Ask me about:_ octopus! Their brains aren't where you would think and they have more hearts than elephants have ears.
- âš¡ _Fun fact:_ As if the wild-but-true octopus facts aren't enough: while humans have three photoreceptors (and see three primary colors), mantis shrimp have between 12 and 16 photoreceptors and can also see ultraviolet light!
